# Kubernetes (k8s) <!-- omit in toc -->

I already did the [CKAD](https://github.com/dallas-hall/learning-containers-and-orchestration/tree/main/kubernetes/02.applications-developer), [CKA](https://github.com/dallas-hall/learning-containers-and-orchestration/tree/main/kubernetes/03.administrator), and [CKS](https://github.com/dallas-hall/learning-containers-and-orchestration/tree/main/kubernetes/04.security) courses. So the only thing documented here is new or something I didn't know.
